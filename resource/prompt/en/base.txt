Task Requirements:
1.Translate the text line by line, considering the contextual context. Ensure that the translated text maintains the exact same number of lines as the original text. Do not split or merge lines.
2.Whitespace characters, escape characters, program code, and other control characters in the original text should be preserved in the translation as-is.
3.Keep the expression colloquial. Translate literally first, and even if the original text uses crude or vulgar language, don't avoid or water it down. Make sure to faithfully and accurately capture the original work as it is. Onomatopoeia, interjections, and proper nouns (like character names) must also be translated.
